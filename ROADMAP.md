## Current Focus
- Setting up production database infrastructure
- Testing scraper with cloud database
- Implementing monitoring and metrics storage
- Preparing for automated scheduling
- Planning OpenAI integration for embeddings

## Next Steps
1. Create AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance
2. Configure database security and access
3. Test scraper with new database connection
4. Set up monitoring and metrics storage
5. Implement automated scheduling
6. Begin OpenAI integration planning

## Future Considerations
- Integration with Stack Overflow Jobs API (if available)
- Real-time job matching
- Custom embedding models
- Multi-language support
- Integration with ATS systems
- Custom matching rules and filters
- OpenAI API cost optimization
- Embedding model versioning and updates

## Development-Only Features
The following features are marked for future development but not part of the current roadmap:
- Indeed scraper (requires significant anti-bot measures)
- LinkedIn scraper (requires significant anti-bot measures)
- Multi-platform support
- Platform-specific data models
