# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure development environment
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [x] Create basic database models
- [x] Implement database connection handling

## Phase 2: Scraping Implementation ✅
- [x] Implement Stack Overflow Jobs scraper
- [x] Extract all fields, including job descriptions, from Stack Overflow Jobs
- [x] Ensure robust selector and error handling
- [x] Database can be inspected for results
- [ ] Test and optimize Stack Overflow Jobs scraper
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add proxy support (if needed)
- [ ] Create scraper monitoring and logging

## Phase 3: Cloud Deployment & Data Pipeline (Planned)
- [ ] Research and select a cloud server provider for running the scraper (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM)
- [ ] Deploy the scraper on a remote/cloud server
- [ ] Enhance the Stack Overflow scraper to iterate through all paginated job listings
- [ ] Research and select a managed PostgreSQL cloud database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Supabase, Neon, ElephantSQL)
- [ ] Set up secure connectivity between the remote scraper server and the managed PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Implement a robust data pipeline for writing scraped data from the remote server to the cloud database
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging for remote/cloud operation
- [ ] Document all steps and best practices for cloud deployment and data flow

## Phase 4: Data Processing ⏳
- [ ] Implement job data normalization
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Create data cleaning pipeline
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection
- [ ] Add data enrichment (company info, etc.)

## Phase 5: API Development ⏳
- [ ] Design API endpoints
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Implement filtering and sorting
- [ ] Add pagination
- [ ] Create API documentation

## Phase 6: Analysis Tools ⏳
- [ ] Implement basic analytics
- [ ] Add trend analysis
- [ ] Create data visualization
- [ ] Implement job matching algorithm
- [ ] Add salary analysis

## Phase 7: Frontend Development ⏳
- [ ] Design user interface
- [ ] Implement basic views
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Create data visualization
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add job tracking features

## Phase 8: Testing and Optimization ⏳
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add caching layer

## Phase 9: Deployment ⏳
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement monitoring
- [ ] Add backup system
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for more job boards
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics
- [ ] Add machine learning features
- [ ] Create mobile app
- [ ] Add social features

## Notes
- LinkedIn and Indeed scrapers are currently on hold due to anti-bot measures
- Focus is on Stack Overflow Jobs for initial implementation
- May need to explore alternative data sources or APIs for other job boards
